#### Interviews
Interviewed two friends about their experiences with management software. 

##### _Insights_
For R. De La Hoz major pain point were: 
* **load time** 
  The software tended to load everything at once and it was a bunch of data. This meant a lot of waiting around for him.
* **contact limitations**
  The software was built in such a way that users could access the information but not necessarily act on it directly. This meant that if Mr. De La Hoz needed to connect an available asset to a project he would need to leave the application to make the request via email and to set things up outside of the application, only to then return to the application to update that asset's state.

For N. Conceição major pain point were: 
* **elements can only be asscociated to each other in a top down fashion** 
  In order for assets within the software to be managed they need to be created into specific entities and saved within a top down structure. To make a new group for example all elements of that group need to exist within the system individually. It is not possible for her to just add new elements from the grouping interface or from any other point within the flow. Considering that asset states are very flexible it is very time consuming to keep everything in order.
* **the interface makes it a bit hard to know what different actions, buttons, etc. do**
  There are many bells & whistles in the sofware she uses but it is so dense that at times it is very hard to know what actions can be taken from where. There is also quite a bit of seemingly random redundancies that require a long time to get used to.

##### _Insights_
* **a bit behind on their tech**
  Agents spend most of their time dealing with paperwork. Finding wasys to make their workflow less error prone is paramount..
* **accessing updated paperwork is really important and could save time**
  Because of the importance of paperwork agents need to have easy access to the most updated paperwork the carrier has to offer as well as easy access to a wide variety of forms, perhaps even input paths.
* **email seems to be their primary tool**
  Since a lot of their work is contact based, agents reaching out to clients, agencies to MCAs and to carriers, carriers back to agencies and angents, etc., it behooves us to integrate email into the workflow. It's the first place they seem to look at.

#### Mapping things out
